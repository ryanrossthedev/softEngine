--*INSTALLATION AND USAGE*--

1. after downloading the files, do whatever you want with my "*incredible innovation*"
2. if you're someone who actually wants to run the "**software**", paste the contents of the python script in to whatever application you'd prefer to run the script on.
3. redownload for the latest version, as the software is provided "**AS IS**" and does not auto-update. (*as if you'd benifit from it auto-updating*)

--*END*--
