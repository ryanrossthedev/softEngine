--*INSTALLATION AND USAGE*--

1. after downloading the files, do whatever you want with my "*incredible innovation*"
2. if you're someone who actually wants to run the "**software**", paste the contents of the python script in to whatever application you'd prefer to run the script on. (Replit or Google Colab are popular web options if you don't want to install any additional software.)
3. redownload for the latest version, as the software is provided "**AS IS**" and does not auto-update. (*as if you'd benifit from it auto-updating*)
